100 Days of DSA
Welcome to my 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This journey is a comprehensive deep dive into the core concepts of computer science, focusing on honing my problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews.

📚 About the Project
This repository is a chronicle of my 100-day commitment to mastering data structures and algorithms. Each day, I tackle new problems, explore different concepts, and implement solutions in JAVA programming language. The goal is to develop a robust understanding of DSA principles and improve my coding proficiency.

🚀 Goals
Master Key Concepts: Gain a thorough understanding of essential data structures and algorithms.
Problem-Solving Skills: Enhance my ability to solve complex problems efficiently.
Coding Interview Prep: Build a strong foundation for acing technical interviews.
Consistency: Cultivate a habit of daily practice and continuous learning.

🛠️ Structure
The repository is organized into daily folders, each containing:

README: A brief summary of the day's topics and learnings.
Code: Implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JAVA language.
Notes: Detailed explanations, insights, and tips related to the day's focus area.

📅 Progress
Day 1-10: Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists


🏆 Highlights
Comprehensive Coverage: All major data structures and algorithms explored.
Multiple Languages: Code implementation in Java.
Problem-Solving Techniques: Step-by-step solutions to various DSA problems.
In-Depth Explanations: Detailed notes and commentary for each topic.

🌟 How to Use
Feel free to explore the repository and use the code and notes to enhance your own understanding of data structures and algorithms. Each day's folder is self-contained, so you can dive into any topic that interests you.
